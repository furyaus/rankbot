PUBG Rank Bot

The 101-club Discord - https://discord.gg/2vDWqw9shM

Project Definition:
The 101-club discord would like a bot that can auto assign roles based on the PUBG in game ranked level. These need to be customisable so that the names can be changed. They need to auto update roughly every 15mins. 

Further development would be around reporting stats to a channel on demand as well as leader board regular postings to a specific channel.

Project Approach:
Previous python code can be provided for a bot which worked last year. This template will make this project relatively straight forward. We have PUBG API access so pull the stats is quite well documented. 

Project Timelines:
Expecting that this whole project will be around 6 hours solid work along with testing and refinement. Once project has commenced, need to see a testing phase within 3 days. 

Project Extension:
This project could lead to future opportunities within the PUBG scene across the world.
